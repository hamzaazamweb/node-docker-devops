About the Flow:
docker exec -it containernameorid (bash/sh/zsh)

1) We created different compose files for prod and dev environments but 
another docker-compose.yml that have the same things between the environment.

2) We can overwrite startup command in docker file in the docker compose file.

3) Arg are the arguments that we can specify at the image build time.

4) We could have created two different docker files for prod and dev environment 
without writing the bash script inside.

5) printenv command to run the environment variables inside the container.

6) docker-compose down -v to delete the volumes when putting down 
the containers.

7) named volumes for database persistance.

8) as named volumes can be used other services we need to specify volumes separately

9) docker volume prune = will remove unused volumes

10) docker network ls 
11) docker inspect containernameorid
12) docker logs container-id -f (follow logs)
13) use service name declared inside compose instead of ips because dns is built 
in docker compose (it creates new network)
14) docker network inspect networkname
