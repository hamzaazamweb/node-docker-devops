About the Flow:
We created different compose files for prod and dev environments but 
another docker-compose.yml that have the same things between the environment.

We can overwrite startup command in docker file in the docker compose file.

Arg are the arguments that we can specify at the image build time.

We could have created two different docker files for prod and dev environment 
without writing the bash script inside.

printenv command to run the environment variables inside the container.
